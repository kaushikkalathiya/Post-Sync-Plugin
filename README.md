# WordPress Post Sync & Translation Plugin

This plugin syncs posts from a **Host site** to one or more **Target sites** in real time using the WordPress REST API. On the Target site(s), posts are automatically translated into a chosen language (French, Spanish, Hindi) using the **ChatGPT API**.

## üîÑ How Real-Time Push Works

When a post is **published or updated** on the Host site, the plugin instantly pushes the post data (title, content, excerpt, categories, tags, featured image) to all configured Target sites. The Target validates the request with HMAC signing, then translates the content **chunk-by-chunk** (1.5‚Äì2.5k characters) via ChatGPT, preserving HTML structure. The translated post is then created or updated immediately‚Äîno cron jobs.
